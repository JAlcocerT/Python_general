A way to connect to the official Linkedin API.

Prerequisites:

* You should be running a php server, I tested it with [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
* Remember to create a folder inside C:\xampp\htdocs, in our case could be: C:\xampp\htdocs\linkedin.
* Just copy the content on API - Linkedin on the folder that we just created.
* Remember to adjust the content of init.php with your credentials and to have at list, the following url authorized
to redirect your linkedin app: http://localhost/callback.php
* Then, after having XAMPP running and starting Apache, we could open a web browser and type localhost/linkedin, which
 will load the content saved in our folder
