### Instructions

After registering in <https://openai.com/api/> and having our API_KEY, we can use the GPT-3 (Deep learning trained model {transformers}) as our natural language processing (NLP) provider in our python scripts.

Take into account that there is a limit on the free tokens that we can get from the model, after that the computational cost will be charged to the user of GPT-3.
